# GodAmp

Modern Winamp clone made in Godot, featuring my own visualizers and fully cross-platform support.

I made this as a submission for the Tool Jam 5 and as a learning project, since I've always wanted to make a music visualizer.

I plan to eventually turn this into its own player, with full customization. For the sake of bringing the old internet feel, but using modern tools.
