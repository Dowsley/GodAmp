# GodAmp

A reimplementation of Winamp 2.9 in Godot, with full cross-platform support.

I made this as a [submission](https://neptune-skies.itch.io/godamp) for the [Tool Jam 5](https://itch.io/jam/the-tool-jam-5), since I've always wanted to make a music player with visualizers.

There is a plan to eventually turn this into its own fully customizable player that brings the old internet feel, but built with modern tools and able to run on any platform.
